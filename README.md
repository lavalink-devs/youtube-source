# youtube-source
A rewritten YouTube source manager for Lavaplayer.

This source aims to provide robustness by leveraging multiple InnerTube clients
for requests. Where one client fails, another will try to load the request.
Which clients are used is entirely configurable.

## common
This module provides the base source manager, which can be used with any
`com.sedmelluq.discord.lavaplayer` packages still on major version `1`.

<details>
<summary>Using in Gradle:</summary>

```kotlin
repositories {
  // replace with https://maven.lavalink.dev/snapshots if you want to use a snapshot version.
  maven(url = "https://maven.lavalink.dev/releases")
}

dependencies {
  // Replace VERSION with the current version as shown by the Releases tab or a long commit hash `-SNAPSHOT` for snapshots.
  implementation("dev.lavalink.youtube:common:VERSION")
}
```

</details>
Example usage:

```java
YoutubeAudioSourceManager youtube = new YoutubeAudioSourceManager();
// Optionally, you may instantiate the source with a custom options, such as toggling use of searching, and clients.
YoutubeAudioSourceManager youtube = new YoutubeAudioSourceManager(/*allowSearch:*/ true, new Client[] { new Music(), new Web(), new AndroidTestsuite() });
```

You may also extend the `Client` interface to support additional InnerTube clients. There are a few abstract classes to
make this easier, notably, `MusicClient` (for `music.youtube.com` InnerTube clients), `NonMusicClient` (for youtube.com
innertube clients) and `StreamingNonMusicClient` (for clients that can be used to stream videos).

Support for IP rotation has been included, and can be achieved using the following:
```java
AbstractRoutePlanner routePlanner = new ...
YoutubeIpRotatorSetup rotator = new YoutubeIpRotatorSetup(routePlanner);

rotator.forConfiguration(youtube.getHttpInterfaceManager(), false)
    .withMainDelegateFilter(null) // This is important, otherwise you may get NullPointerExceptions.
    .setup();
```

## v2
This modules expands on `common` by providing additional support for
Lavaplayer `2.x` clients, such as [Lavalink-Devs/Lavaplayer](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/lavaplayer).
Such features currently include thumbnail support within `AudioTrackInfo`.
Additional clients are included that provide access to this additional information.
These clients are suffixed with `Thumbnail`, such as `WebWithThumbnail`, `AndroidWithThumbnail` etc.

<details>
<summary>Using in Gradle:</summary>

```kotlin
repositories {
  // replace with https://maven.lavalink.dev/snapshots if you want to use a snapshot version.
  maven(url = "https://maven.lavalink.dev/releases")
}

dependencies {
  // Replace VERSION with the current version as shown by the Releases tab or a long commit hash `-SNAPSHOT` for snapshots.
  implementation("dev.lavalink.youtube:v2:VERSION")
}
```

</details>

Example usage:
```java
// same as the 'common' module but there are additional clients that provide video thumbnails in the returned metadata.
YoutubeAudioSourceManager youtube = new YoutubeAudioSourceManager(/*allowSearch:*/ true, new Client[] { new MusicWithThumbnail(), new WebWithThumbnail(), new AndroidTestsuiteWithThumbnail() });
```

## plugin
This module serves as the plugin for use with [Lavalink](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink).

To use this plugin with Lavalink, you must declare the dependency.

<details>
<summary>Using with Lavalink v3:</summary>

```yaml
lavalink:
  plugins:
    # Replace VERSION with the current version as shown by the Releases tab or a long commit hash for snapshots.
    - dependency: "dev.lavalink.youtube:youtube-plugin:VERSION"
      repository: "https://maven.lavalink.dev/releases" # use https://maven.lavalink.dev/snapshots if you want to use a snapshot version.
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Using with Lavalink v4:</summary>

```yaml
lavalink:
  plugins:
    # Replace VERSION with the current version as shown by the Releases tab or a long commit hash for snapshots.
    - dependency: "dev.lavalink.youtube:youtube-plugin:VERSION"
      snapshot: false # Set to true if you want to use a snapshot version.
```

</details>

Configuring the plugin:
```yaml
plugins:
  youtube:
    enabled: true # Whether this source can be used.
    allowSearch: true # Whether "ytsearch:" and "ytmsearch:" can be used.
    allowDirectVideoIds: true # Whether just video IDs can match. If false, only complete URLs will be loaded.
    allowDirectPlaylistIds: true # Whether just playlist IDs can match. If false, only complete URLs will be loaded.
    # The clients to use for track loading. See below for a list of valid clients.
    # Clients are queried in the order they are given (so the first client is queried first and so on...)
    clients:
      - MUSIC
      - ANDROID_TESTSUITE
      - WEB
      - TVHTML5EMBEDDED
```

**Advanced Options**
```yaml
    # The below section of the config allows setting specific options for each client, such as the requests they will handle.
    # If an option, or client, is unspecified, then the default option value/client values will be used instead.
    # If a client is configured, but is not registered above, the options for that client will be ignored.
    # WARNING!: THE BELOW CONFIG IS FOR ILLUSTRATION PURPOSES. DO NOT COPY OR USE THIS WITHOUT
    # WARNING!: UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT DOES. MISCONFIGURATION WILL HINDER YOUTUBE-SOURCE'S ABILITY TO WORK PROPERLY.

    # Write the names of clients as they are specified under the heading "Available Clients".
    WEB:
      # Example: Disabling a client's playback capabilities.
      playback: false
      videoLoading: false # Disables loading of videos for this client. A client may still be used for playback even if this is set to 'false'.
    TVHTML5EMBEDDED:
      # Example: Configuring a client to exclusively be used for video loading and playback.
      playlistLoading: false # Disables loading of playlists and mixes.
      searching: false # Disables the ability to search for videos.
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must make sure to disable the built-in YouTube source like so:
```yaml
lavalink:
  server:
    sources:
      youtube: false
```

> [!NOTE]
> Existing options, such as `ratelimit` and `youtubePlaylistLoadLimit` will be picked up automatically by the plugin,
> so these don't need changing.

## Using a `poToken`
A `poToken`, also known as a "Proof of Origin Token" is a way to identify what requests originate from.
In YouTube's case, this is sent as a JavaScript challenge that browsers must evaluate, and send back the resolved
string. Typically, this challenge would remain unsolved for bots as more often than not, they don't simulate an entire
browser environment, instead only evaluating the minimum amount of JS required to do its job. Therefore, it's a reasonable
assumption that if the challenge is not fulfilled, the request origin is a bot.

To obtain a `poToken`, you can use https://github.com/iv-org/youtube-trusted-session-generator, by running the Python script
or the docker image. Both methods will print a `poToken` after a successful run, which you can supply to `youtube-source`
to try and work around having automated requests blocked.
Specifying the token is as simple as doing:
```yaml
plugins:
  youtube:
    poToken: "paste your token here"
```
You do **not** need the `visitor_data` that is also produced by the script.

> [!NOTE]
> A `poToken` is not a silver bullet, and currently it only applies to requests made via the `WEB` client.
> 
> At the time of writing, the most effective method for working around automated request blocking is to use IPv6 rotation.

## Migration from Lavaplayer's built-in YouTube source

This client is intended as a direct replacement for Lavaplayer's built-in `YoutubeAudioSourceManager`,
which has been deprecated in a recent release of [Lavalink-Devs/Lavaplayer](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/lavaplayer).

When using `AudioSourceManagers.registerRemoteSources(AudioPlayerManager)`, Lavaplayer will register its own
deprecated `YoutubeAudioSourceManager`, which must be disabled.
Some versions of Lavaplayer may include an optional `excludeSources` parameter, allowing you to toggle the adding of the source.
If the version you are using does not support this, you will need to manually register each `AudioSourceManager` yourself.

First, create and register an instance of the supported `YoutubeAudioSourceManager` from the `youtube-source` package.
```java
AudioPlayerManager playerManager = new DefaultAudioPlayerManager();
YoutubeAudioSourceManager ytSourceManager = new dev.lavalink.youtube.YoutubeAudioSourceManager();
playerManager.registerSourceManager(ytSourceManager);
```

If your version of Lavaplayer supports an `excludeSources` parameter or equivalent, you may exclude the built-in
`YoutubeAudioSourceManager` using the following:
```java
AudioSourceManagers.registerRemoteSources(playerManager,
                                          com.sedmelluq.discord.lavaplayer.source.youtube.YoutubeAudioSourceManager.class);
```

Otherwise, you will need to register each source manager individually.

In addition, there are a few significant changes to note:

- This source's class structure differs so if you had custom classes that you were initialising
  the source manager with (e.g. an overridden `YoutubeTrackDetailsLoader`), this **is not** compatible
  with this source manager.

- Support for logging into accounts as a means of playing age-restricted tracks has been removed, with the
  `TVHTML5EMBEDDED` client instead being the preferred workaround. There were a large number of
  reasons for this change, but not least the fact that logging in was slowly becoming problematic and deprecated
  on the YouTube backend. The amount of code to support this feature meant that it has been axed.
